				<h2>This is how our <strong>Question Answering System</strong> works</h2>
				<p>To undestand natural langauage and return relevant answers, AskNow applies intelligent analysis techniques, built on Deep Learning as well as semantic pparsing-based approaches.</p>
				<p>We begin by structuring data and knowledge into a noise-free knowledge graph. To do so, we go through the availabe resources and find the entities and the relationships between them. Additional ontologies may also be linked as a coherence layer, to cover different aspects of the content and apply an industry-ready structure to it. Thereafter, AskNow can interact and communicate with the knowledge graph and answer factual questions, which refer to the facts expressed there.</p>
				<p>We look forward to having AskNow embedded into various enterprise information systems, solutions and services and letting it improve reaactively, by leanring during its use to give more contextually relevant answers.</p>
